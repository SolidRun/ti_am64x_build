Subject: [PATCH 1/8] pci: j721e: assert reset-gpio before deassertion to
 ensure reset

Optional reset gpio is already being deasserted after a 100us delay,
however no specific state has been set since devm_gpiod_get_optional.
Thus successful reset of pci card depends on a bootloader / firmware to
assert the reset line during every (re-)boot.

Explicitly assert reset-gpio to ensure reset sequence occurs independent
from boot-loader, firmware or soc reset defaults.

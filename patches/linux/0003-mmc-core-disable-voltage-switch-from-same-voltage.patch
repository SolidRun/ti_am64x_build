Subject: [PATCH 3/9] mmc: core: disable voltage-switch from same voltage

Per TI SDK v8 this was a workaround for Samsung eMMC connected to TI
AM6442 SoC to enable HS200 mode.
After initial detection of mmc card Linux will initiate voltage-switch
to 3.3V or 1.8V - after which communication to the eMMC times out for
unknown reasons.

Skipping this procedure when the host controller is already configured
for 1.8V avoided the problem completely.

Since TI SDK v9 (based on Linux 6.1) the emmc card was not detected in
the first place, i.e. no mmc messages since probe of bus 0:
[    1.664913] mmc0: SDHCI controller on fa10000.mmc [fa10000.mmc] using ADMA 64-bit
[nothing]

Removing the voltage switch now causes first attempt at enabling hs200
to fail, and second to succeed:
[    1.608186] mmc0: CQHCI version 5.10
[    1.664913] mmc0: SDHCI controller on fa10000.mmc [fa10000.mmc] using ADMA 64-bit

Subject: [PATCH 08/11] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am64-main: icssg1_mdio: fix clock
 reference

icssg1_mdio should use the same clock that is used by icssg1 core.
"icssg1_coreclk_mux" already selects iclk ("&k3_clks 82 20") over
core_clk ("&k3_clks 82 0").

When icssg1_mdio selects core_clk and is probed before
icssg1_coreclk_mux, a deadlock occurs because the mux clock can never
probe. This lead to cascading failure probing pru netdevs.

Update icssg1_mdio clock reference to iclk.
